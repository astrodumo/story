Extend your hands to God and turn your hearts to Him, for all pillars are weak and his pillar is the most eternal.
I can't restrain my growing curiosity.
Unknown to you, you take pride in stating your own convictions, when you're angry, your reasoning is clouded by unfair judegement.
Dedication to a misguided cause.
